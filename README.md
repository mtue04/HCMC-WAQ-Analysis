# Weather and Air Quality Analysis in Ho Chi Minh City

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between weather conditions and air quality in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. By leveraging real-world data, the goal is to uncover insights that can help improve understanding of the factors influencing air pollution in the city. From there, we can implement health protection measures for the local population against the effects of air quality.

## Objectives
1. Collect relevant data on weather and air quality for Ho Chi Minh City.
2. Preprocess and clean the data for analysis.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand trends and patterns.
4. Build predictive models to quantify the impact of weather on air quality.
5. Identify key factors contributing to poor air quality and provide mitigation recommendations.
